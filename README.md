**Just my basic dotfiles along with some installation scripts that make my life easier when I'm moving to a new machine or doing a clean install.**

### To-do:
* automatically install brew?

* script to backup my essential directories to an external hard drive

* ~~add installation of ipython & jupyter~~

### Commands I will likely instantly forget: 
To search for a formula/package:  
`$ brew search {pkg_name}` 

To install an application using brew cask:  
`$ brew cask home {app_name}`  
`$ brew cask install {app_name} `
